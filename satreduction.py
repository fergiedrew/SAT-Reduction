# https://udallas.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/47383/viewContent/504108/View

# Problem Description:

# Given a rectangular grid with some of the squares 
# blocked off, is there a tour that will visit all of the remaining squares exactly once? 
# Figure A to the right is such an example input. The answer is "Yes" for this input, as shown 
# by the blue curve below in Figure B. The input below, in Figure C, yields a "No" answer for this problem.
# Input will be a string in this format: Height Width block block block ...
# For example: 3 5 (5,1) (2,2) (3,2) would be the input for Figure A.
# (There will be spaces between, and no spaces within.)
